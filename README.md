## PROPOSAL 

## My Routine Application

### Introduction

Everyone has a list of tasks that they want to complete or wish to achieve within a period of time. Some people are doing their task impromptu and some of them are very composed in the arrangement of their daily activities. From this situation, we are inspired to develop a neat to-do list application that will help these people to stay organized with their daily life activities. This application is going to help the user to list down all the personal activities that they want to accomplish, assist in listing out their shopping list and also can cooperate with holding on to their wishlist. Users can use this application anywhere and anytime that they want to freely. 
 
This whole post-pandemic situation makes people want to do outdoor activities and dine-in eating at restaurants or cafes more after isolating themselves for this past previous year. To help reduce the time for choosing while queuing at the counter, this application that we want to propose hopefully will be able to give comfortability for both customers in the store and the shop owners equally. This application can be used by the user from their respective table in the shop for them to choose the menu and after they receive their order confirmation which is the total payment they are needed to pay, they will go directly to the counter to settle the bill via cash payment.   

Even before this whole pandemic situation, people are always try to complete a pile of tasks daily or within a set of time period. Some people are doing their task impromptu and some of them are very composed in the arrangement of their daily activities. From this situation, we are inspired to develop a neat to-do list application that will help these people to stay organised with their daily life activities. This application is going to help the user to list down all the personal activities that they want to accomplish, assist in listing out their shopping list and also can cooperate with holding on to their wishlist. 


### Objective

- To develop a listing system that enables the users to login the application using their username and password.
- To develop a listing system that enables the users to list down their tasks that they want to accomplish within a set of time that they want to complete it.
- To develop a listing system that enables the users to delete the list of tasks upon the completion of the task.
- To develop a listing system that can update the listed task whenever the user wants to.


### Function and Features

1. Login

Users are needed to put their username and their password. During this action, we decided to use a database from Firebase.

2. Scaffold Widget Drawer

Users get to browse through and navigate to personal list, shopping list and wishlist from the drawer function at the appbar. The final list of tasks are categorized 
in each page of the user choices of task list such as personal, shopping or wishlist respectively.  

3. Add list

The user will be able to add the list of tasks that they want to do in the application.

4. Delete list

Users can delete the task list whenever they have finished their tasks. 

5. Update the list

Once the user has confirmed and added their list, they still will be able to update or correct any typing errors in the list. 

### Conclusion

The usage of smartphones and mobile devices helps to bring in improvement in connecting with others, keep organized and functions as a personâ€™s personal self-reminder. 
The routine list application will be able to reduce the traditional approach of listing tasks on paper that is risky where people might lose the paper or could have 
smudged the handwriting on the paper while trying to complete the list. In other words, the application will work as a mobile sticky note of a to-do list for the user. 
Hence, this proposed system is developed in order to improve the user productivity in solving their daily tasks and keep them planned for the user to finish up.

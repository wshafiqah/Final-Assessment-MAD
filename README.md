## Proposal

### SweetDesserts Application

### Introduction
This whole post-pandemic situation makes people want to do outdoor activities and dine-in eating at restaurants or cafes more after isolating themselves for this past previous year. To help reduce the time for choosing while queuing at the counter, this application that we want to propose hopefully will be able to give comfortability for both customers in the store and the shop owners equally. This application can be used by the user from their respective table in the shop for them to choose the menu and after they receive their order confirmation which is the total payment they are needed to pay, they will go directly to the counter to settle the bill via cash payment.   

### Objective
- To develop a dessert ordering system that enable the users to login the application using their username and password
- To develop a dessert ordering system that enable the users to browse and select  the menu of the cakes
- To develop  a dessert ordering system that enable the users to remove from the order list
- To develop a dessert ordering system that calculate the total price and display the receipt for the user make the payment

### Function and Features
1. Login
    Users are needed to put their username and their password. During this action, we decided to use a database from Firebase.
2. Menu
    Users get to browse through the list of menus in the shop with the details of cake ingredients and price for each slice.
3. Add order
    The user will be able to add the menu into their order list. 
4. Discard order
    Users can delete the menu from their order list if they want to change their choices. 
5. Receipt/Total Page
    Once the user confirms with their order, they will be needed to proceed to payment and this is where the calculation happens and the user will be displayed with the      total payment that they need to pay at the counter. 

### Conclusion
Using mobile devices to place orders can help to bring in improvement sales and customers when they are ordering the food either they dine in or take away. The dessert ordering system will help the customers  to reduce the need to queue up at the counter to order the food and take them. With the system, the customers can easily order the dessert at the table and wait for their services from the restaurants. Thus, this proposed system is developed in order to improve the current food ordering system.
